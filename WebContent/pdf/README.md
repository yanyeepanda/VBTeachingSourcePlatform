# pdf.js

pdf.js is a technology demonstrator prototype to explore whether the HTML5
platform is complete enough to faithfully and efficiently render the ISO
32000-1:2008 Portable Document Format (PDF) without native code assistance.

pdf.js is not currently part of the Mozilla project, and there is no plan
yet to integrate it into Firefox. We will explore that possibility once
pdf.js is production ready. Until then we aim to publish a Firefox
PDF reader extension powered by pdf.js.

Our demo site is here:
